### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a network programmer and a software engineer, currently working on building awesome multiplayer video games. My work and interests are primarily in backend development, with experience in API design, web tools development and feature/system engineering. I am always eager to learn about online systems and their designs/architecture.
